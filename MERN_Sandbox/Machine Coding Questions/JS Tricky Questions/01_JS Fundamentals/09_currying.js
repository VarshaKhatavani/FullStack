 * * Q.1) What is function currying?
 * * Q.2) const multiplication=a=>b=>c=>return a*b*c. What will this statement do? Explain in detail.
 * * Q.3) Explain practical usage of function currying. */

// ** closure vs curring

// * Currying breaks down a complex function into smaller, reusable units.
// * Currying allows you to pre-fill some arguments of a function and
// * create a new function with the remaining arguments

// * currying is useful in such cases to pass the partial parameters
