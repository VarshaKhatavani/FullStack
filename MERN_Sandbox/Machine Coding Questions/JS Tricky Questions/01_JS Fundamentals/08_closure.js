/* Q.1) How can you access private variable or function outside the scope ?
 *
 * Ans : Using Closure
 *
 * Q.2) Explain the advantage of closure ?
 *
 * Ans : The main adv of "closure" is that any member which is private for certain
 *       scope can be accessed keeping it private so that the variable is away from
 *       any accidental change of value.
 *
 *       Accessing private member with closure pattern assure better approach of
 *       making a variable global.

// Using Closure make  private/local variable act as global variable.
// few members which you want outer function can access based on condition.
